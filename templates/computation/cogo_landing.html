                                Welcome to Cogo! As an extension of the MySurveyor platform, Cogo was developed as an
                                accessible way of solving land survey
                                computations. <br><br>
                                The tool is part of the the <strong>MySurveyor</strong> platform which aims to digitize
                                the Geo-spatial and
                                Land Surveving process in Zimbabwe
                            </p>
                            <h4>Using Cogo</h4>
                            <p class="text-muted">You can start entering data and performing calculations as soon as
                                Cogo loads. If you
                                don't need to save your work, just exit the browser window when you're finished. Leaving
                                Cogo or refreshing the page will erase any unsaved data.</p>
                            <h4>Saving & Loading Your Work</h4>
                            <p class="text-muted">
                                If you want to save your work to your computer, first name your job at the left side of
                                the
                                title bar. Next, click the <strong>Save</strong> icon to save to your local
                                machine as a custom Cogo file, or export a common CSV file. <br><br>

                                Open saved Cogo jobs or import a common CSV file by clicking on the
                                <strong>File</strong> icon.
                                Cogo files have a <code>.qcg</code> file extension
                                and can only be used by Cogo. <br><br>

                                You can also copy comma-separated or space-separated points files by choosing "Edit",
                                then
                                pasting the text contents into the points record. Save space-separated points by
                                choosing
                                "Select", then copying the record into a text file. <br><br>

                                You can copy and paste the contents of any output record into a text file to reference
                                later
                                by choosing "Select". The contents of all records are saved with a Cogo file, but not
                                with
                                a CSV file.

                                Cogo will automatically sketch points, lines, and all COGO operations. Sketches
                                automatically zoom to the most relevant area, but you can zoom or pan manually for a
                                better
                                view. Arcs and lines can be drawn at any time to provide context. On a large monitor,
                                expand
                                the sketch by clicking the <i class="fa fa-expand fa-lg"></i> in the top right

                                Azimuths and angles must be entered in DMS, of the form DDD.MMSSSS... or
                                DDDÂ°MM'SS.SS..."
                                (seconds decimals allowed). Quadrantal bearings can be entered by indicating the
                                quadrant,
                                for example "SW" followed by the bearing. Entering (or clicking) two points separated by

                                dots ('Pt1..Pt2') will retrieve the distance or azimuth inverse between those points.
                                Simple
                                mathematical expressions are allowed. Data can be entered by clicking on sketch points.

                                Point names and descriptions may be up to 8 characters. Any spaces will be replaced with
                                underscores ('_'). Point names must not include commas (',') asterisks ('*') or dashes

                                All Cogo operations have been extensively checked; however, the possibility of error
                                (especially with erroneous input) still exists. Be sure that results make sense, and
                                double-check important work. <br><br>
