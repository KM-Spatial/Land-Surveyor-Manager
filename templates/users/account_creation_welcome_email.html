Hi {{ user }},

Welcome to My-Surveyor - Zimbabwe's digital platform for Geospatial Engineers.

We believe you will like it here. Our platform is always available at {{ domain }}. Please feel free to schedule a
demo of the platform by emailing us on kumbirai@kms.co.zw.

What is currently available?
    Geodetic Control Network App - The application is being used to easily find control points in Zimbabwe with some added functionality that we believe
    will be of relevance to your work

    Geocoding - Find coordinates of places around the world while also finding the place names based on coordinates.

    Coordinate Converter - Easily transform coordinates from one Coordinate Reference System (CRS) to the other.

Guess what? Our platform is unique as it allows you to save all your work and come back later for it.

*More features are currently on their way. And yes, you can also request some additional features by responding to this email
